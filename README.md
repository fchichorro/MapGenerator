# MapGenerator
The simplest random map generator. Individual grid cells can be of four different colors.

This model creates maps with up to four different types of patches. This is useful when one wants to create random maps with different qualities of patches for agents to interact with. The advantage of this algorithm over a totally random one is that connectivity between patches of the same type is assured in some way.
